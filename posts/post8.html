        NVDA went from 130 to 155 ish and fell back to 130 in merely three weeks after writing the blog. I bought 40 calls right before writing the blog, sold 20 at 144 and bought 1000 shares at the same time. Sold another 20 at 152 the second day. Just bought back 500 shares at 135. Still experimenting on the dip buying process but it is powerful indeed. Why share prices have such large volatility, even for a 3 trillion company?
        I'm reading some <a href="https://focusedcompounding.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Joel-Greenblatt-Class.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> lately and I'll borrow one sentence from it: I don't know and I don't care.

            My dip-buying journey continues. I find it very hard to talk about my ongoing dip-buying trades, but I'll give it a try:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. I bought 150 calls of EWZ when it was trading at 23 in December. My guess is that the fear of Trump supporting Bolsonaro will soon fade. And commodity prices will somehow recover a bit. The price of EWZ was stabilizing at 22-23 range and looked like a good buy. So far I'm right and EWZ is trading at 25.5. Commodity prices have been recovering and Trump only cares about money. Seriously, accounting for exchange rates, EWZ hasn't moved yet. Trade is still ongoing, and let's see how it goes.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. I just bought 2000 shares of Ubisoft, a dying game producer that has been constantly making low quality games recently. Facing multiple debacles since last year and vows to change its structure. Claims to have cut 200 million euro of cost. Shareholder sentiment cannot be worse, and I see no signs of improvement. Incels hate this company so much because of the DEI emphasized in its games (Is this hate even necessary, incels?). However, the stock price stabilizes at the range of 11-13. This, to be honest, fits perfectly into what I discussed in a previous <a href="https://shindoz95.github.io/something-about-money/posts/post3.html" target="_blank">post</a> about redemption and sentiment. Ubisoft had its redemption in 2013 and it knows how to do it (still the same owner). I say, why not have some (limited) fun? Worst case is Ubisoft getting acquired by some large companies like Tencent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3. I haven't bought dips in NVDA yet (but I believe that I should). The deepseek drama is most likely a fade. Wall street needs new stories every month.

            So many people out there trying to talk like an expert in everything. I'm gonna be a degenerate as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you believe that all these data centers built by Stargate and large tech companies still need chips from Nvidia, then this is a dip to load more shares. I did. Bought 500 shares at 116. We'll see. All I can say is it will take many months if not years for a 3 trillion company to show cracks. Just take a look at apple. Do not take narratives seriously.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Feb 12th, 2025 Update:
        </p>
        <p>
            So, yesterday I was talking with a friend about markets and upcoming CPI report. He was buying dips in Tesla stock yesterday. I said, today's CPI report might cause the market to drop, but this will most likely be a fade. Simply because the consensus was pricing 4-5 rate cuts for 2025 in October but by yesterday it was pricing 0-1 cuts (that info was from Nick Timiraos, Jerome Powell's fav WSJ journalist). Things cannot be worse on the inflation side, threrfore, CPI number doesn't matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today I woke up at 5:10 and saw Tesla dropped 2% pre-market. Bought 200 immediately at 321.5. Later I was told that was the low for the day. Market panicked after the CPI report but soon miraculously recovered. Tesla didn't even budge during the "sell off".
        </p>
        <p>
            1. I sold 1000 NVDA at 134 on Monday and Tuesday. Bought 500 at 116 and 500 at 122 a week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. I now have 5000 shares of Ubisoft. It's amusing to see most gamers wanting Ubisoft to die. It reminds me of the last time I saw many Japanese people hoping for the downfall of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Summary: They are a bunch of morons who live & lost in narratives and never act in their own best interests. (Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9JWUj4DvHw" target="_blank">loser</a>. Two years ago, I commented under this video, "Some look forward, while some look backward.") Alas, I think Ubisoft is a easy 3X from here. 10X is questionable and also might take a decade. However, things seem to move much faster nowadays. Prices move fast, look just like 06-08 period. I'm not implying a coming crisis, though. 
        </p>
        <p>
            BTW, just checked this loser's Youtube channel. He's still offering subscriptions and "financial" videos. Ah, meaning this poor bastard is still struggling making money in the ACTUAL market.
        </p>
        <p>
            But again, at some point, I also forgot to look forward on my value stocks.

        <p>
            I'm hating this drama already. Although the tariff is likely another fade, putting most money on US-related stuff is exhausting. I'm back to -5 ~ 0% year to date. Should I be happy because of my performance relative to my large crypto holdings (which is down about 30 - 40%)? No. And I'm tired of Trump. And I do way better on European/Japanese stocks (because of low volatility and lower valuations). I guess I will keep my dip buying journey but majority of my money will get moving in the upcoming pumps. I say there is 50/50 chance either I got trapped in the Crypto narratives or I profit from it. I'll keep holding this shit for some more time.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the whining aside, a responsible dipper should buy NVDA now.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Mar 11th, 2025 Update:
        </p>
        <p>
            FOMC meeting is on March 18-19. Opex is on 21st. Nasdaq down 15% since 2 weeks ago. I mean, it is somehow idiotic if someone is expecting more downside from here.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is likely the bottom between now and Opex. As a responsible dipper, should buy NVDA for a brutal bounce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hard to be responsible right now. Which means I have probably bought a lot of NVDA yesterday, and am preparing to buy more once bottom is comfirmed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            BTW, Mar 21st call option on 68 TQQQ is roughly 1.2. 100 call options cost 12K but represent 2M Nasdaq. I think that's pretty exciting and dangerous. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But, hey! I bought call options on a shitco called Kratos. 60 call options when traded at 27, sold at 35 during the volume spike. Bought back 40 calls at 25 and sold at around 29 yesterday during the volume spike (again). I probably could use that profit for TQQQ options. And I probably have bought some already.
        </p>
        <p>
            I once heard someone saying, "sold $DJT at XXX, the volume was good." I recently found volumes to be pretty interesting indicators to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
            One important lesson: I should have never gotten influenced by my friend and traded Tesla. Do dirty works with small companies that no one watches.
        </p>
        <p>
            One simple observation: Trump is helping Elon to <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1899557926525677856?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank">pump</a> Tesla stocks today. Meaning Trump is probably likely done with tariffs at least between now and opex.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Mar 12th, 2025 Update: Thoughts after today's CPI report
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, 15 minutes after CPI report, the market has bounced pretty hard. Accounting for options and futures, I added about 6M of QQQ in the past 2 days. (Which was just 2M futures and 200 TQQQ call options as discussed above.)
        </p>
        <p>
            If the market is choppy for another several months, there're quite a lot of opportunities in NVDA. Looking back, it was already quite obvious on Saturday that trading at 105, market made a mistake on NVDA. Because a 3 trillion company will never drop 30% in 2 weeks and never come back. Much can be learned from Apple, which had mediocre earnings from 2022-2024 but price kept bouncing at a range. Something can be also learned from SMCI, a fraudulent company that had its share price quadrupled in early 2024. It got almost delisted from Nasdaq several months ago and not a single accounting firm was willing to sign on their financial statements. Quadrupled again since then. Rome didn't fall in a day and can't fall in a day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            BTW, just heard that this was the 5th fastest market correction since 1950. Okay...
        </p>
        <p>
            When TSLA was dropping like a stone, narratives were that Elon was hated by everyone because he supported Trump. Also his insider siblings were selling the stock. Now I just saw that EV (electric vehicle) sales are up 50% YoY for Febuary and are up 30% YTD. Following narratives is never a viable strategy.

        <p>
            I have no idea what will happen next, and I took most leverage off. This rally is weak so far, and I lost all my money on options. However, made a lot on futures. I do believe QQQ should be able to reach 510 before the next drama, but I'm too tired to bet on it.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, I'm moving some money to European and value stocks. These stocks also suffered big losses during the sell off and valuations look attractive.      
        </p>
        <p>
            Sold some of my Ubisoft shares. The new AC Shadows is mediocre. Therefore, the biggest question regarding Ubisoft is: What are the sales/earnings numbers look like in the next 3 years? TBH I don't think even the CEO has a clue. This is a stock with uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
            BTW, CD Projekt is trying to enter the mobile game market again. They keep trying and they are doing it right.
        </p>
        <p>
            CD Projekt's earnings release today shows that 411 developers working on Witcher 4, 84 on Orion, and 49 on Sirius and 17 on Hadar. I'll say this for one last time: Cyclicality is gone! Stock should be 3X when the market realizes that.
        </p>
        <p>
            CD Projekt shares are down 15% because the management confirmed that the Witcher 4 will come out in no earlier than 2027. These "traders" are quite something if they were expecting the release earlier than 2027. Please sell harder, I want to buy it at a cheaper price!
        </p>
        <p>
            Just saying, the road map for next three years should look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            Late 2026: Start releasing trailers and game plays. Bullish, pump it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Early 2027: Game release being delayed to early 2028. Terrified, dump it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Mid 2027: New trailer looks good. Bullish, pump it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Early 2028: Game about to be released. Excited, pump it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Just start buying now and occationally watch for the volume and trade a tiny bit of it. Judging from the volume, CDR just reached a local bottom. Shame, I know.
        </p>
        <p>
            I probably will not talk too much about CD Projekt any more. Not much uncertainty at this point. This is a good management that knows what they're doing.
        </p>            
        <p>
            God bless CD Projekt and my stocks!

        Mar 29th, 2025 Update: Ubisoft Spin-off
        </p>
        <p>
            Things change fast. Ubisoft is creating a new subsidiary, which has new managment and Tencent owns 25% of the subsidiary. Ubisoft is moving all its "good" and "lean" assets into this new subsidiary. By just looking at it, Ubisoft is sending a strong message: I don't want to die!
        </p>
        <p>
            A new subsidiary is usually only the step one of many moves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Stock was up 10% on the news but closed red for the day. Seriously?
        </p>
        <p>
            Dare I say it: Ubisoft is going up. Look at the volume on Friday ffs.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Apr 5th, 2025 Update: Crazy market crash
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a very special time that I want to recommend thinking about buying US stocks. NVDA has now a trailing twelve months P/E of 32. Google 19. Amazon 31. They were probably a little cheaper during the 2022 bear market bottom. However, their earnings were negative or shrinking in 2022. Now, all three companies are growing at 20% annually.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, when situations are bad, people ignore the outlook. And I know history earnings are deceiving. You could argue that their earnings will be cut down due to Trump-induced recession. Yes, tech companies might look very stupid for investing so much if AI gets trashed during the next economic downturn.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this is the time to get excited and probably optimistic. Trump will likely get forced to drop the tariff very soon. He may even drop it before the 9th. Rome is falling but slowly falling. It still has the best class monopolies of the world. Things will never stay this bad. And even if this is the start of a depression, let's confirm the situation first. If earnings are terribly bad going forward, let's confirm it first. But the point always is, don't be overwhelmed by fear. This is probably not the bottom for the next 12 months or 24 months. But this is unwise to expect several 5% drawdowns next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some good companies are cheap. I don't doubt that they might become cheaper. Trump can always make another harmful drama both for long term and short term. In the worst case, companies deserve a cheaper valuation based on reduced earnings. And in the worst cases, European and Japanese markets aren't immune to the economic damages. But that is not going to happen right away. But there's always hope, and there's always a bull market somewhere. And let's confirm the worst case first. But for now, this is the moment to think about getting a bit greedy.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Apr 9th, 2025 Update: Crazy market rally
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned one lesson in the past 3 months: You never go broke by taking profits. Watch for 30Y yields.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, I bought 1.6 million of QQQ and 200 call options on bitcoin etf IBIT last Friday. Sold all QQQ now and bought another 200 options on IBIT. Ha, now I've got some time to think about Ubisoft. I'm sure about one thing: Ubisoft has more upside than downside. Anecdotal news: Some activist investors are calling for €23/share special dividend.
        </p>
        <p>
            BTW, CD Projekt didn't drop below 200 PLN, which was the low post earnings. This is very bullish. It might take the entire European market to bring down CD Projekt further.
        </p>
        <p>
            God bless CD Projekt and my stocks!

        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Apr 12th, 2025 Update: Out of the cave
        </p>
        <p>
            Last week the 30Y yield passed 5% briefly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The previous two times 30Y reached 5% was Oct 2023 and Jan 2025. Fed officials changed their tone regarding inflation right after the yield increase in Oct 2023. They also softened their tone on rate cuts early this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time is a bit different because "Fed ready to stabilize markets if needed." Wow, something they never said before during this hiking-cutting cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who's going to win? Fed or "bond vigilantes"? Anon, pick a side. I bought 10 ZB futures on Friday. That's about 1 million of 30y bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think what people don't understand at this point is that to push yields higher, you are not just fighting the Federal Reserve, but the central banks all over the world. Because of the collaborations among central banks, and significantly more crises that other countries went through, hard to believe they don't owe Federal Reserve any favor. Think about the Yen depreciation and European bond crisis in 2022.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Things became interesting when Trump dropped some tariffs on computers and chips over the weekend. There is no more justification for dumping bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
           Once tariff pressure starts to wane, and cool down in inflation becomes obvious, the Federal Reserve likely wil start to cut rates again. But more importantly, when bonds rally from here, stocks likely also go up. QQQ was up 20% Nov 2023 - Feb 2024. And it was up 8% from Jan 13th to Feb 19th in 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            Micron ($MU) is something worth looking at. It dropped from $110 to $65 due to tariffs. Just imagine the speed how it is going back to $100.

        Apr 19th, 2025 Update: Does Trump have a script?
        </p>
        <p>
            Attacking Fed chair, trashing the economy, sounds like something Trump would do. I've heard from someone that Trump actually had a 60 day script that started from Jan 31st to put tariffs on every country, then a 30 day script to focus on China. I actually believe what this guy said because of his accuracy on lots of previous events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay...The second script is about finished. And Trump did many seemingly redundant things that I doubt might be linked to the third script, that is, if he had one.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't care about stocks market." "I don't even watch it." Are these cruel comments even necessary? Stocks market is the economy. 80% of the consumption is contributed by the top 20%. Which means a bear market is definitely hurting the economy because for top 20%, wealth is mostly in stocks or private shares. Moreover, the economy has been slowing down since last summer, making the market more sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assuming that Trump does have scripts, I wonder if the third script is about crypto - an asset class that is immune to attacks on fundamentals. Trashing the traditional stocks market might let crypto look more attractive. While Trump's loyal dogs all bought loads of crypto, maybe its time to feed them? Of course, it's gonna be hard to believe that Trump has scripts.

            People remain skeptical about the rally, fearing that mf Trump might pull the rug again. That's precisely why the potential returns over the next few months could be rewarding.

            Trump is caving from tariffs. Fed is cutting rates. Waller made that clear today. May 7th, or worst, June 18th. May I propose an interesting opportunity?

            Leverage long on Nasdaq index (QQQ) on May 2nd, 4th, targeting 9th; June 13th, 16th, targeting 20th. My guess is that bitcoin (IBIT) works as well. You have to place bets on Friday because Nick Timiraos will definitely leak the info on Sunday, and you can place additional bets on Monday to avoid uncertainty over the weekends.

            You know that was the bottom when you see 18 P/E on Google, and 32 P/E on Nvidia. Not because this is a low P/E ratio, but it has not been this low post 2020 (or even 2016)! Why this time should be different?

            No, probably no rate cuts.

            Wow, CD projekt is up 10% today and 25% since April 9th. I don't even want to know why. Probably because losers now realise Take Two is shit (which is down 15% at some point today)?

            Jokes aside, GTA 6 will make Take Two a lot of money because of micro transactions. And this income can last for many years because this is an online-based game that can be constantly updated for new contents.

            However, not trying to underestimate but how much money can be made for the stock to be attractive? Take Two has a market cap of nearly 40 billion. I seriously doubt it.

            Anyways. God bless CD Projekt and my stocks.
