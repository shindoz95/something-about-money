        The pandemic was a seismic event for the entire market. Stocks stayed cheap for quite some time - some even lingered at bargain-bin prices longer than others. Industrials, for example. And what fascinates me - at least personally - is how people manage to become absurdly pessimistic precisely when things hit rock bottom.
        Take Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) trading at 2500 or so in 2021. People were practically eulogizing the company, saying, “This company is dead, and here’s a 1000-tweet thread explaining why (1/1000).” There are so many such idiots. I’m not exaggerating, but if these kinds of idiots were told to eat shit, humanity would instantly lose its classification as omnivores.

        Mitsubishi Heavy axed its regional jet program in 2021—an ambitious money pit that bled them dry year after year while showing no glimmer of hope. Naturally, the dung-eaters erupted in celebration, shouting, “This company has no future! It’s dying!” Oh, absolutely.

I can still vividly recall December 2022, when CRM slashed its workforce in a brutal culling. Michael Burry, never one to miss a chance at being wrong in public, rushed to Twitter to proclaim that the stock should be down instead of up after such layoffs: “CRM should have been down 25% on those job cuts. Job cuts are so not the reason to own that.”

And just as vividly, I remember a few months ago when Boeing cut its workforce—and its stock shot straight up. But wait, let’s not forget James Chanos, the self-proclaimed “Enron killer,” chiming in with his pearls of wisdom. “In the dot-com bubble, markets also reacted positively to job cuts, and look what happened.” Sure, Mr. Chanos is so brilliant that he had to shut down his funds because of - what’s the term? - shitty returns.

Why? Because companies, unlike the armchair doomsayers, actually have a will to survive. But go ahead—keep betting against them. Someone’s gotta provide liquidity for the rest of us.</p>
