        CD Projekt Red hath unveiled the first spectacle for "The Witcher 4," wherein Ciri, the fostered daughter of Geralt of Rivia, taketh the mantle of lead protagonist. Yet, alas, the quality of this spectacle appeareth mediocre, burdened with tired and weary tropes, and an ill-favored visage of Ciri.
        </p>
        <p>
        Pray, must I ponder—doth this stand as the most grievous spectacle that CD Projekt hath e'er bestowed upon us? Perchance it is so; yet, what doth it signify?
        </p>
        <p>
        To this query, my answer is brief: nay, I find no cause to fret—at least, not as of now. Let us delve into three strata of thought concerning this matter:
        </p>
        <p>
        Stratum the First: The spectacle is lackluster, a mirror reflecting, in part, mishandling within the artifice of marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Stratum the Second: The endeavor hath but freshly commenced full craft, and ample room for refinement remaineth. Moreover, CD Projekt is known to weave and reweave the threads of its tale ere release (recall the variance betwixt the true visage of "Cyberpunk 2077" and its heralding at E3 in the Year of Our Lord 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
        Stratum the Third: Weak-hearted men may divest themselves of their holdings, fearing the ruin of the company from a single ill-received spectacle. When this tempest of selling neareth its quietus, I shall seize the chance to acquire more of their forsaken shares.
        </p>
        Many voices cry out, lamenting that female protagonists spell doom for commerce. But hark! Hast thou not heard of "Assassin's Creed: Odyssey"? Verily, one of the greatest diversions e'er conceived!    
        </p>
        <p>
    Verily, I must confess that this spectacle lacketh the fervor and passion, which be the common thread binding the triumphs of noble games. Lo, thou mayest witness the trail of 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVjkqB3LH0" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53MyR_Z3i1w" target="_blank">Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK4iAjzAoas" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Origin</a>, 
    or 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZpHzBKCqU" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>.  
    These diversions didst herald great gains in the coffers of their creators, and their tales remain as sagas to be cherished through the ages. Yet, I perceive that this game hath but lately embarked upon its journey of craft, and perchance the artisans had little to unveil. Nevertheless, the spectacle, as it standeth, doth appear most grievous indeed.
