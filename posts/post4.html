        The entire thought process started in mid 2023 when I was looking at 10-Q of mag 7 (Apple, Amazon and Microsoft) during the dotcom bubble. Excluding some awful years due to the macro environments, good companies have 
            the ability to have good free cash flow. They re-invest their money, expand their business, and make more revenue and profit next year. At least to me, a good business is just that simple. Ideally, it has little competition,
            and stays unnoticed. And if they can expand freely, I think buying back stocks can be a really dumb idea. However, Nvidia and CD projekt both bought back some stocks this year.

        The gaming industry is truly fascinating. Several key elements contribute to a successful game. First, the gameplay must be engaging and enjoyable. A compelling story is also essential. Furthermore, developers must excel at marketing their games to generate strong revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
        Although CD Projekt Red now focuses solely on RPGs - following several unsuccessful ventures into mobile gaming—it has achieved tremendous success and generated substantial profits through its RPG titles. It boasts one of the best marketing teams in the industry, having brought its flagship franchises, Cyberpunk and The Witcher, to the screen through collaborations with Netflix.

        I came across an intriguing <a href="https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CD_Projekt_SA/3334574255" target="_blank">post</a> about CD Projekt. While it likely reflects common perceptions about the company, I found its arguments idiotic and mathematically flawed in almost every respect. This is the internet, so let’s indulge in some well-deserved shaming. Jeez, look at his other postings! Behold this poor fool and his utterly pathetic, shitty, stinky commodity picks.  
        Honestly, it’s a miracle he hasn’t committed seppuku out of sheer embarrassment. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before we even get to the numbers, let’s take a moment to admire just how laughably stupid and utterly devoid of research this so-called “short report” is - better described as a formal invitation to bankruptcy:
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        AAA single player games have short life cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then this genius decides to compare CD Projekt with Take-Two because, apparently, completely different business models and earnings profiles don’t matter. Bro, have you even glanced at their earnings history? Spot any differences? By the way, it is way harder to value a business like Take-Two but this dude talks like a pro. What makes things funnier is that top game producers aren't even competing with each other but this dude obviously believes so. From a Ubisoft earnings call
        the CEO said that the release of GTA6 will boost their sales of that year and that's how things work.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        CDR is a “one game at a time” studio, averaging 4-5 years between releases.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is bullshit. What is it with company's valuation? You calculate value based on future cash flow, not some stupid narratives or publishing frequencies. And numbers will adjust themselves. But let me tell you a secret: CD Projekt is no longer a “one game at a time” studio. It kept 30% profit margin. It kept shipping its crappy products. 
        It fixed all the problems, and moved on to the next project. Built two new studios in North America. Now CD Projekt is starting to develop three projects at the same time.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Now, let's talk about the numbers and why CD Projekt Red is attractive. First I want to talk about a major point, base number of players.
        </p>
        <p>
        My guess is that the number of gamers have increased dramatically in the past decade.
        </p>
        <p>
        CD Projekt Red's revenues for the period 2020–2023 are as follows (in billion PLN): 2.14, 0.89, 0.95, and 1.23. If the base number of console players did not increase during this period, it would have been unlikely for them to achieve 1.23 billion in 2023. An alternative explanation is that the revenue in 2020 was significantly reduced due to Cyberpunk refund requests. In that case, the estimated revenue for 2020 could have been around 3 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, let's compare this with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which generated 0.80 billion PLN in revenue in 2015. The player base roughly tripled between 2015 and 2020, and it has continued to grow following the pandemic. This raises the question—what will the numbers look like in 2027 when The Witcher 4 is released?
