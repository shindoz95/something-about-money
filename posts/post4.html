        The entire thought process started in mid 2023 when I was looking at 10-Q of mag 7 (Apple, Amazon and Microsoft) during the dotcom bubble. Excluding some awful years due to the macro environments, good companies have 
            the ability to have good free cash flow. They re-invest their money, expand their business, and make more revenue and profit next year. At least to me, a good business is just that simple. Ideally, it has little competition,
            and stays unnoticed. And if they can expand freely, I think buying back stocks can be a really dumb idea. However, Nvidia and CD projekt both bought back some stocks this year.

           Game industry is really interesting. There are several key elements to a successful game. First, game play should be fun. Secondly, a good story is necessary.
