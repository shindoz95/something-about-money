        The entire thought process started in mid 2023 when I was looking at 10-Q of mag 7 (Apple, Amazon and Microsoft) during the dotcom bubble. Excluding some awful years due to the macro environments, good companies have 
            the ability to have good free cash flow. They re-invest their money, expand their business, and make more revenue and profit next year. At least to me, a good business is just that simple. Ideally, it has little competition,
            and stays unnoticed. And if they can expand freely, I think buying back stocks can be a really dumb idea. However, Nvidia and CD projekt both bought back some stocks this year.

        In 2011, when Obama <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-witcher-2015-7" target="_blank">visited</a> Poland. He received a copy of video game "Witcher" as a gift. Obama was told that "it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy."

            Two years later, in 2013, the producer of Witcher went public. Its shares were traded at less than 5 PLN. By 2020, shares traded at 450 PLN at peak.

        The gaming industry is truly fascinating. Several key elements contribute to a successful game. First, the gameplay must be engaging and enjoyable. A compelling story is also essential. Furthermore, developers must excel at marketing their games to generate strong revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is no mere accident that great games can be summarized with one short sentence. For Witcher 2, it's "Find the assassin". For Witcher 3, it's "Find Ciri". For Cyberpunk 2077, it's "Find cure of relic chip". For Red Dead Redemption, it's "Run away from lawmen." CD Projekt is really good at expanding one sentence into a great story.
        </p>

        Although CD Projekt Red now focuses solely on RPGs - following several unsuccessful ventures into mobile gaming—it has achieved tremendous success and generated substantial profits through its RPG titles. It boasts one of the best marketing teams in the industry, having brought its flagship franchises, Cyberpunk and The Witcher, to the screen through collaborations with Netflix. It is one of the only two companies in the industry that maintain high profit margin. - Only one, I should say. Another just got acquired by Microsoft for 70 billion. And I am not here to judge whether they achieved this by underpaying their workers.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Why CD Projekt is trading at a discount price?
        </p>
        <p>
        Because company managers wanted to achieve the revenue target for their stock compensation package. They rushed to publish the Cyberpunk 2077 when it was not ready. Of course, CD Projekt also had to release it in 2020, as the whole story is based on Mike Pondsmith's book Cyberpunk 2020. The game release was a disaster. CD Projekt was forced to refund gamers. But in the end, managers got their stock rewards. Funny the incentive program they are setting for 2025 to 2028 becomes more conservative. To add gas to the fire, the stock was overvalued during the pandemic induced stock bubble.
        </p>
        <p>
        I came across an intriguing <a href="https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CD_Projekt_SA/3334574255" target="_blank">post</a> about CD Projekt. While it likely reflects common perceptions about the company, I found its arguments idiotic and mathematically flawed in almost every respect. For 7 of his investing ideas, he seemed to be wrong on 6 of them. Man, that's way worse than coin toss. The only win is a mere 20% since 2022 - Arguably that is worse than buying short term bonds. This is the internet, so let’s indulge in some well-deserved shaming. Jeez, look at his other postings! Behold this poor fool and his utterly pathetic, shitty, stinky commodity picks.  
        Honestly, it’s a miracle he hasn’t committed seppuku out of sheer embarrassment. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before we even get to the numbers, let’s take a moment to admire just how laughably stupid and utterly devoid of research this so-called “short report” is - better described as a formal invitation to bankruptcy:
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        AAA single player games have short life cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then this genius decides to compare CD Projekt with Take-Two because, apparently, completely different business models and earnings profiles don’t matter. Bro, have you even glanced at their earnings history? Spot any differences? By the way, it is way harder to value a business like Take-Two but this dude talks like a pro. What makes things funnier is that top game producers aren't even competing with each other but this dude obviously believes so. From a Ubisoft earnings call
        the CEO said that the release of GTA6 (from Take-Two) will boost their own sales of that year and that's how things work.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        CDR is a “one game at a time” studio, averaging 4-5 years between releases.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is bullshit. What is it with company's valuation? You calculate value based on future cash flow, not some stupid narratives or publishing frequencies. And numbers will adjust themselves. But let me tell you a secret: CD Projekt is no longer a “one game at a time” studio. It kept 30% profit margin. It kept shipping its crappy products. 
        It fixed all the problems, and moved on to the next project. Built two new studios in North America. Now CD Projekt is starting to develop three projects at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
        This idiot is truly impressive because much can be learned from his mistakes and his disgusting, silly ways of handling problems. These losers are like plague: Pretending to be professional and smart but in fact rotten to the core. He is obviously obsessed with "large companies" that have low single digit margins. (Ah, of course, he also loves commodity companies. I mean, what kind of grown-up likes commodity company?) His investing is based on narratives and irrelevant numbers. For example, comparing units sold between different games instead of analyzing the income numbers. Yes, GTA5 is arguably the best game by far but Take-Two has not been earning much from it. And Take-Two spends too much in developing while being unable to promote their games: They lose money half of the time and they cannot expand their business, that is, unless through dilution and borrowing (man, sucks to be their shareholder). To meet shareholders' expectation for growth, Take-Two has to acquire inferior assets for revenue increase, which is terrible for long term aspect. 
        Inferior assets bring debt, annual losses, and unexpected costs and depreciations. And they wrote off nearly 3 billion of goodwill from Zynga acquisition last year!! Aweful capital management and decsion making, and reminds me of Bayer, which acquired Monsanto.
        CD Projekt, on the other hand, makes good money through good marketing and careful cost management and has ZERO debt. There is no dilution but occasional buybacks.  
        </p>
        <p>
        How about the mobile market. Well, in game industry, most money are being made on the mobile side. But do remember: mobile games have much lower barrier. Therefore, CD Projekt has a good chance of winning a share in the future, although it never shows in valuation.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Now, let's talk about the numbers and why CD Projekt Red is attractive. First I want to talk about a major point, base number of players.
        </p>
        <p>
        My guess is that the number of gamers have increased dramatically in the past decade.
        </p>
        <p>
        CD Projekt Red's revenues for the period 2020–2023 are as follows (in billion PLN): 2.14, 0.89, 0.95, and 1.23. If the base number of players hadn't increased during this period, it would have been unlikely for them to achieve 1.23 billion in 2023 (even with the release of DLC, phantom liberty). An alternative explanation is that the revenue in 2020 was significantly reduced due to Cyberpunk refund requests. In that case, the estimated revenue for 2020 could have been around 3 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, let's compare this with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which generated 0.80 billion PLN in revenue in 2015. The player base roughly tripled between 2015 and 2020 (if not accounting for price increase), and it has continued to grow following the pandemic. This raises the question—what will the numbers look like in 2027 when The Witcher 4 is released?
        </p>
        <p>
        Another evidence is the views of game trailer on Youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw_oH5oiUSE" target="_blank">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, arguably a much more successful game, achieved 15 million views since 2018. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWMu6JeT2g8&t=196s" target="_blank">Witcher 4</a> achieved half of that number in two weeks. I don't want to discuss about the physics, entropy, or whatever behind this. They achieved 8 million views in 2 weeks and that is enough. 
        Only shitheads think they are capable of explaining everything. I just need to know the boundary of not making big mistakes.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Second point is that they are expanding because they have good profits.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the feature that I love the most about good growth stocks. And CD Projekt is doing that. The expansion is veiled by its cyclicality. And when it shows, I get rewarded from stock prices. As said earlier, CD Projekt is now working on three franchises at the same time. The Witcher 4-6, Cyberpunk sequel, and a new title. The latter two are still in concept phase but soon they will catch up. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For Witcher 4-6, they will probably be released in 2027, 2030 and 2033. The Witcher 5-6 will have quicker production time because the larger framework is completed during the development of Witcher 4. The Cyberpunk sequel will come out in, say, 2029 and the new title comes out in 2035. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        I don't want to show my calculation of future earnings, but based on the assumptions above, you will probably get an annual revenue that is close to its current market cap post 2033. And cyclicality will be greatly reduced for this company. Assuming 30-45% profit margin, that's quite exciting. The ultimate shape of CD Projekt Red should look like Capcom: several addictive RPG game franchises (Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, etc.), frequent collaborations with Hollywood... Capcom currently trades at 42 P/E ratio and apply that to a 2033 earnings projection of CD Projekt Red and you get a 14 (42*0.35) bagger from here. And do you need to bother wether to use net earnings or EBIT or EBITDA? Does that even matter? You are probably buying a
        growth company at a lower valuation than that of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at its most broken time. You know what I learned from Mitsubishi? Redemption takes time because people are very stubborn and stupid. And when the public perception changes, it overshoots. At 200 PLN/share, please note there is zero euphoria yet for CD Projekt Red.
