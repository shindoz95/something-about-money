        The entire thought process started in mid 2023 when I was looking at 10-Q of mag 7 (Apple, Amazon and Microsoft) during the dotcom bubble. Excluding some awful years due to the macro environments, good companies have 
            the ability to have good free cash flow. They re-invest their money, expand their business, and make more revenue and profit next year. At least to me, a good business is just that simple. Ideally, it has little competition,
            and stays unnoticed. And if they can expand freely, I think buying back stocks can be a really dumb idea. However, Nvidia and CD projekt both bought back some stocks this year.

        The gaming industry is truly fascinating. Several key elements contribute to a successful game. First, the gameplay must be engaging and enjoyable. A compelling story is also essential. Furthermore, developers must excel at marketing their games to generate strong revenues.

        Although CD Projekt Red now focuses solely on RPGs - following several unsuccessful ventures into mobile gaming—it has achieved tremendous success and generated substantial profits through its RPG titles. It boasts one of the best marketing teams in the industry, having brought its flagship franchises, Cyberpunk and The Witcher, to the screen through collaborations with Netflix.

        I came across an intriguing <a href="https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CD_Projekt_SA/3334574255" target="_blank">post</a> about CD Projekt. While it likely reflects common perceptions about the company, I found its arguments idiotic and mathematically flawed in almost every respect. This is the internet, so let’s indulge in some well-deserved shaming. Jeez, look at his other postings! Behold this poor fool and his utterly pathetic, shitty, stinky commodity picks.  
        Honestly, it’s a miracle he hasn’t committed seppuku out of sheer embarrassment.

        Before we even get to the numbers, let’s take a moment to admire just how laughably stupid and utterly devoid of research this so-called “short report” is - better described as a formal invitation to bankruptcy.

        AAA single player games have short life cycles.

        Then this genius decides to compare CD Projekt with Take-Two because, apparently, completely different business models and earnings profiles don’t matter. Bro, have you even glanced at their earnings history? Spot any differences? By the way, it is way harder to value a business like Take-Two but this dude talks like a pro.

        CDR is a “one game at a time” studio, averaging 4-5 years between releases.

        This is bullshit. What is it with company's valuation? You calculate value based on future cash flow, not some stupid narratives or publishing frequencies. And numbers will adjust themselves.
