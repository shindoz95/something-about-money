        You might have seen me roasting a short seller called John Hempton in my another <a href="https://shindoz95.github.io/something-about-money/posts/post3.html" target="_blank">post</a>.

In fact, I started posting blogs because years ago I was inspired by <a href="https://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2008/10/only-responsible-trade.html" target="_blank">one</a> of his blogs, which is on the topic of today's discussion: short squeeze.
