    You might have seen me roasting a short seller named John Hempton in another <a href="https://shindoz95.github.io/something-about-money/posts/post3.html" target="_blank">post</a>. But to be fair, he’s not that bad if you look at his fund returns. In fact, I started blogging years ago because I was inspired by <a href="https://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2008/10/only-responsible-trade.html" target="_blank">one</a> of his posts, which happens to be on today’s topic: the short squeeze.
</p>
<p>
    John has already told the classic story of an old-fashioned short squeeze: control nearly all the float, lure in naïve short sellers, leave them unable to cover, and then cash in during the panic buying.
</p>
<p>
    But markets evolve, and loopholes eventually close—especially a century-old one. The SEC now requires disclosure of ownership above 5%. The tricks Alan Aloysius Ryan pulled back in the day are no longer legal. Some boomer named “Bill Hwang”, a billionaire who invested 'according to the word of god', tried to resurrect this strategy in January 2021, only to get liquidated two months later. Why? Because unloading that many shares without crushing the stock price is basically impossible. 
    Controlling large stakes through different entities without reporting to SEC is a crime. Our boomer Billy was sentenced to 18 years in prison. What's pretty obvious is that, god did not talk to him. Finance world is where you see all kinds of fucked-up shit all the time.
</p>
<p>
    I’ll admit it: as someone who only started investing in August 2020, I was also drawn into the short squeeze mania. I nearly torched my account, but somehow survived and came out a little wiser. Otherwise, you’d never be reading this blog.
</p>
<p>
    While Bill Hwang was like an old samurai wielding a katana on a battlefield full of drones, someone else was experimenting with a new style of short squeeze.
</p>
<p>
    Alan Aloysius Ryan had to physically buy up all the Stutz shares in the 1910s because he had no way of convincing others to create the buying frenzy for him. It was always a simple demand-supply problem: if he owned 80% of the shares, the remaining 20% would inevitably be bought at sky-high prices. But what if Alan could get others to do the dirty work for him? A rich friend, perhaps? No—rich people aren’t that dumb.
</p>
<p>
    What if, instead, you got the most desperate people in society to buy shares on your behalf? People with less education, easier to manipulate, and most importantly, know nothing about valuation. Just convince them they’ll get filthy rich after “the squeeze.” The problem was, in the 1910s, Alan didn’t have social media to pump his message, and he’d still need a lot of poor people to soak up that last 20%.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to 2021, and the game changed. You could now use online platforms to convince millions of desperate people that by buying worthless stocks like GME and AMC, they’d become overnight millionaires. The cruel part? The people most aggressively targeted were those least equipped to resist—hookers, junkies, the homeless, and the jobless. They truly WANTED to believe it because they are desperate for money.
</p>
<p>
    This is a brief description of the 2021 short squeeze summarized by ChatGPT: "In early 2021, retail traders on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets triggered historic short squeezes in GameStop (GME) and later AMC Entertainment (AMC) by piling into heavily shorted stocks, often using options to amplify the pressure. GME skyrocketed from about $20 to $483 in January as hedge funds like Melvin Capital, caught massively short, faced billions in losses, while AMC surged from $2 to $72 by June, allowing the struggling theater chain to raise cash and avoid bankruptcy. The phenomenon exposed the fragility of overleveraged short positions, forced brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, and demonstrated how coordinated retail investors armed with social media and commission-free trading could shake Wall Street’s foundations." 
</p>
<p>
    However, I don’t feel sorry for 99% of the victims who bought AMC and GME at the top, daydreaming about getting rich quick. Not at all. They obviously didn’t realize they were the idiots buying the last 20% of the shares. When they got lured into the short squeeze, they had one thing crystal clear in their minds: they wanted to burn down the “hedgies” (hedge funds) and make the rich suffer, one big reason why they got attracted by this scheme. The funny part? Aside from a few hedge funds that actually got caught in the squeeze, these retail traders ended up being the only real victims (because they were not only the buyers for the last 20%, but ultimately also the buyers when the other 80% got sold). Like I said in another post, never enjoy others' pain.
</p>
<p>
    You know what was so interesting? The two types of short squeeze actually happened simultaneously in Jan 2021. The moral of my story perhaps is: stay safe, this is a dangerous world.
