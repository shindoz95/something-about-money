        Saw this video, which turns Witcher game into fractions of 1980s movie scenes. As someone who likes Witcher 3, I don't feel offended at all, surprisingly. It looks amazing and I cried.

        AI is real, and people are fervently exploring its applications for their own interests. We are merely witnessing its very beginning. New platforms will emerge—a new Netflix, perhaps new movie stars, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
        Watch closely—this is the future. And this is why, even at a P/E of 55, Nvidia is probably still a buy. Its P/E ratio is shrinking because earnings are outpacing its stock price. People are uncertain about near-term growth, and such concerns are legitimate. But 10 years from now, the world will be entirely different, and Nvidia and OpenAI (perhaps) will be major contributors. 
        Remember, you don't predict the rate of change. Because you can't. That's why you shouldn't bet on a slow down in growth for the next 3 years.
        </p>

        I shall add, “buy every dip in NVDA.” Sounds easy but good execution requires conviction.

        But hey, it reminds me of a clip I saw last night, posted by one of my favorite Twitter accounts:

        Guess you might wonder: Do I invest based on such a video, or some drunk, vague imaginations on the future? Well...Here are some facts about Capex increases in 2025:
        </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        $MSFT CFO: "FY25 capex expected to be higher than FY24"
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$META CFO: "..expect significant CapEx growth in 2025.."
            </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$GOOGL CEO: "the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing"
            </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$AMZN CFO: "capital investments to be higher in H2 24"
    </p>
        <p>
        So...Do you really think you can buy $NVDA at a P/E of 30, which is lower than $AAPL or $MSFT? Because if not, then you should buy every dip of $NVDA starting from now.

        NVDA went from 130 to 155 ish and fell back to 130 in merely three weeks after writing the blog. I bought 40 calls right before writing the blog, sold 20 at 144 and bought 1000 shares at the same time. Sold another 20 at 152 the second day. Just bought back 500 shares at 135. Still experimenting on the dip buying process but it is powerful indeed. Why share prices have such large volatility, even for a 3 trillion company?
        I'm reading some <a href="https://focusedcompounding.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Joel-Greenblatt-Class.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> lately and I'll borrow one sentence from it: I don't know and I don't care.

            My dip-buying journey continues. I find it very hard to talk about my ongoing dip-buying trades, but I'll give it a try:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. I bought 150 calls of EWZ when it was trading at 23 in December. My guess is that the fear of Trump supporting Bolsonaro will soon fade. And commodity prices will somehow recover a bit. The price of EWZ was stabilizing at 22-23 range and looked like a good buy. So far I'm right and EWZ is trading at 25.5. Commodity prices have been recovering and Trump only cares about money. Seriously, accounting for exchange rates, EWZ hasn't moved yet. Trade is still ongoing, and let's see how it goes.
        </p>

            2. I just bought 2000 shares of Ubisoft, a dying game producer that has been constantly making low quality games recently. Facing multiple debacles since last year and vows to change its structure. Claims to have cut 200 million euro of cost. Shareholder sentiment cannot be worse, and I see no signs of improvement. Incels hate this company so much because of the DEI emphasized in its games (Is this hate even necessary, incels?). However, the stock price stabilizes at the range of 11-13. This, to be honest, fits perfectly into what I discussed in a previous <a href="https://shindoz95.github.io/something-about-money/posts/post3.html" target="_blank">post</a> about redemption and sentiment. Ubisoft had its redemption in 2013 and it knows how to do it (still the same owner). I say, why not have some (limited) fun? Worst case is Ubisoft getting acquired by some large companies like Tencent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3. I haven't bought dips in NVDA yet (but I believe that I should). The deepseek drama is most likely a fade. Wall street needs new stories every month.
        </p>

            So many people out there trying to talk like an expert in everything. I'm gonna be a degenerate as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you believe that all these data centers built by Stargate and large tech companies still need chips from Nvidia, then this is a dip to load more shares. I did. Bought 500 shares at 116. We'll see. All I can say is it will take many months if not years for a 3 trillion company to show cracks. Just take a look at apple. Do not take narratives seriously.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        Feb 12th, 2025 Update:

        <p>
            So, yesterday I was talking with a friend about markets and upcoming CPI report. He was buying dips in Tesla stock yesterday. I said, today's CPI report might cause the market to drop, but this will most likely be a fade. Simply because the consensus was pricing 4-5 cuts for 2025 in October but by yesterday it was pricing 0-1 cuts (that info was from Nick Timiraos, Jerome Powell's fav WSJ Journalist). Things cannot be worse on the inflation side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today I woke up at 5:10 and saw Tesla dropped 2% pre-market. Bought 200 immediately at 321.5. Later I was told that was the low for the day. Market panicked after the CPI report but soon miraculously recovered. Tesla didn't even budge during the "sell off".
        </p>
        <p>
            1. I sold 1000 NVDA at 134 on Monday and Tuesday. Bought 500 at 116 and 500 at 122 a week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. I now have 5000 shares of Ubisoft. It's amusing to see most gamers wanting Ubisoft to die. It reminds me of the last time I saw many Japanese people hoping for the downfall of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Summary: They are a bunch of morons who live & lost in narratives and never act in their own best interests. (Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9JWUj4DvHw" target="_blank">loser</a>. Two years ago, I commented, "Some look forward, while some look backward.") Alas, I think Ubisoft is a easy 3X from here. 10X is questionable but also might take years.
