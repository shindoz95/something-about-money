        Saw this video, which turns Witcher game into fractions of 1980s movie scenes. As someone who likes Witcher 3, I don't feel offended at all, surprisingly. It looks amazing and I cried.

        AI is real, and people are fervently exploring its applications for their own interests. We are merely witnessing its very beginning. New platforms will emerge—a new Netflix, perhaps new movie stars, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
        Watch closely—this is the future. And this is why, even at a P/E of 55, Nvidia is probably still a buy. Its P/E ratio is shrinking because earnings are outpacing its stock price. People are uncertain about near-term growth, and such concerns are legitimate. But 10 years from now, the world will be entirely different, and Nvidia and OpenAI (perhaps) will be major contributors. 
        Remember, you don't predict the rate of change. Because you can't. That's why you shouldn't bet on a slow down in growth for the next 3 years.

        I shall add, “buy every dip in NVDA.” Sounds easy but good execution requires conviction.

        But hey, it reminds me of a clip I saw last night, posted by one of my favorite Twitter accounts:

        Guess you might wonder: Do I invest based on such a video, or some drunk, vague imaginations on the future? Well...Here are some facts about Capex increases in 2025:
        </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        $MSFT CFO: "FY25 capex expected to be higher than FY24"
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$META CFO: "..expect significant CapEx growth in 2025.."
            </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$GOOGL CEO: "the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing"
            </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
$AMZN CFO: "capital investments to be higher in H2 24"
    </p>
        <p>
        So...Do you really think you can buy $NVDA at a P/E of 30, which is lower than $AAPL or $MSFT? Because if not, then you should buy every dip of $NVDA starting from now.

        NVDA went from 130 to 155 ish and fell back to 130 in merely three weeks after writing the blog. I bought 40 calls right before writing the blog, sold 20 at 144 and bought 1000 shares at the same time. Sold another 20 at 152 the second day. Just bought back 500 shares at 135. Still experimenting on the dip buying process but it is powerful indeed. Why share prices have such large volatility, even for a 3 trillion company?
        I'm reading some <a href="https://focusedcompounding.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Joel-Greenblatt-Class.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> lately and I'll borrow one sentence from it: I don't know and I don't care.
