        Saw this video, which turns Witcher game into fractions of 1980s movie scenes. As someone who likes Witcher 3, I don't feel offended at all, surprisingly. It looks amazing and I cried.

        AI is real, and people are fervently exploring its applications for their own interests. We are merely witnessing its very beginning. New platforms will emerge—a new Netflix, perhaps new movie stars, and so much more.

        Watch closely—this is the future. And this is why, even at a P/E of 55, Nvidia is probably still a buy. Its P/E ratio is shrinking because earnings are outpacing its stock price. People are uncertain about near-term growth, and such concerns are legitimate. But 10 years from now, the world will be entirely different, and Nvidia and OpenAI (perhaps) will be major contributors. 
        Remember, you don't predict the rate of change. Because you can't. That's why you shouldn't bet on a slow down in growth for the next 3 years.

        I shall add, “buy every dip in NVDA.” Sounds easy but good execution requires conviction.

        But hey, it reminds me of a clip I saw last night, posted by one of my favorite Twitter accounts:
