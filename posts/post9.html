        It has become increasingly clear that the Federal Reserve’s future direction will be shaped not by economic orthodoxy, but by political loyalty. With President Donald Trump now well into his second non-consecutive term, attention inevitably turns to who will replace Jerome Powell when his term as Chair ends in May 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we’ve observed is not subtle. Trump’s criteria for selecting senior officials are consistent and brutally transparent. Competence may be welcome, but loyalty is non-negotiable. And not just passive loyalty—but an active, almost theatrical willingness to repeat and reinforce his bullshits, regardless of whether they align with established facts or macroeconomic realities.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are looking at a fundamentally different Federal Reserve by mid-2026. A Fed that will not only cut short-term interest rates, but also likely cease quantitative tightening (QT) and begin an aggressive round of quantitative easing (QE)—perhaps one of the largest since 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what am I blathering about? I think an extreme scenario is that the bull market can last until the mid-term. While the economy is cooling fast, there are several main themes that are
            currently driving the market that are still running hot.
        </p>

            First is the giant AI spending between Nvidia, Microsoft, Oracle etc. makes it easier for revenues to continue to grow. Although buying products between large companies doesn't bring organic growth, the balance sheet will look amazing for a while longer, that is, while the music is still playing. And market will buy that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Second is, of course, the new FED chair, and potential QE starting from May 2026. This is big, bringing interest rates down, not only for the short term rates but also long term rates, will ultimately stimulate growth. Bitcoin can rip on the liquidity increase and market will follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third is MF Trump's willingness to secure an okay midterm.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are quite some sectors being sold hard because of the economic slowdown and recession fears (e.g. retailers, homebuilders), it is interesting to look into these sectors. I understand that dip-buying is a very difficult decision because "what if this is the start of a recession, a very bad one?"
            What if this is it? This kind of fear comes to everyone who buys the dip, and that's why one successful dip-buying can generate crazy returns. I'm talking about 40% to 80% usually. You need to know, while narratives can sometimes be very negative, there's always hope. People are good at making changes and narratives change quickly.
