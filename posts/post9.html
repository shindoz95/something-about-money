        It has become increasingly clear that the Federal Reserve’s future direction will be shaped not by economic orthodoxy, but by political loyalty. With President Donald Trump now well into his second non-consecutive term, attention inevitably turns to who will replace Jerome Powell when his term as Chair ends in May 2026.

            What we’ve observed is not subtle. Trump’s criteria for selecting senior officials are consistent and brutally transparent. Competence may be welcome, but loyalty is non-negotiable. And not just passive loyalty—but an active, almost theatrical willingness to repeat and reinforce his bullshits, regardless of whether they align with established facts or macroeconomic realities.

            We are looking at a fundamentally different Federal Reserve by mid-2026. A Fed that will not only cut short-term interest rates, but also likely cease quantitative tightening (QT) and begin an aggressive round of quantitative easing (QE)—perhaps one of the largest since 2020.
