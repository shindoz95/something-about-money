        It has become increasingly clear that the Federal Reserve’s future direction will be shaped not by economic orthodoxy, but by political loyalty. With President Donald Trump now well into his second non-consecutive term, attention inevitably turns to who will replace Jerome Powell when his term as Chair ends in May 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we’ve observed is not subtle. Trump’s criteria for selecting senior officials are consistent and brutally transparent. Competence may be welcome, but loyalty is non-negotiable. And not just passive loyalty—but an active, almost theatrical willingness to repeat and reinforce his bullshits, regardless of whether they align with established facts or macroeconomic realities.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are looking at a fundamentally different Federal Reserve by mid-2026. A Fed that will not only cut short-term interest rates, but also likely cease quantitative tightening (QT) and begin an aggressive round of quantitative easing (QE)—perhaps one of the largest since 2020.
        </p>
        <p>I believe we have now entered a 10-month window of heightened volatility. Market participants will be forced to price in not only Trump’s domestic and foreign policy unpredictability but also the increasing likelihood that monetary policy will be politicized.</p>
        <p>In that environment, three asset classes stand out as asymmetric plays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong> – As we saw in 2020–2021, the return of aggressive QE, especially paired with institutional skepticism, is rocket fuel for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-term government bonds</strong> – Despite inflation concerns, if the Fed re-enters the long end of the curve with heavy purchases, yields will fall and bond prices will rally. Think TLT.</li>
    <li><strong>Homebuilder stocks</strong> – If the Fed targets housing explicitly (as it did post-2008), builders may rally on expectations of lower rates and greater stimulus-driven demand.</li>
  </ul>
