        I asked ChatGPT to generate a diaglog where Sollozzo pitches Bitcoin to Don Corleone (tried to use Sora but the video is somehow disappointing), and here is what I have:
        </p>
        <div class="container">
        <h1>Bitcoin Pitch Scene</h1>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p>Don Corleone, I come to you with an offer. A <em>revolutionary</em> investment. Not drugs, not gambling—no. This is the future. The currency of tomorrow... <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p>Bitcoin? Hmph. Sounds... exotic. What is this Bitcoin?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p>Digital gold, Don Corleone. Decentralized. No banks, no middlemen. Just code. It's fast, secure, and untouchable by governments. You invest now, you make a fortune.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p>And who controls this... Bitcoin? Who do I speak to if something goes wrong?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(smiling slyly)</span> Nobody, Don. That's the beauty of it. It's a trustless system. Pure math.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(his tone sharpens)</span> Hmm. No control? No guarantees? If I can’t hold it in my hand, it doesn’t exist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(laughing lightly)</span> With respect, Don Corleone, the world is changing. The young—they don’t trust the old ways. They want independence. This... this is the new way to power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(leans forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous calm)</span> You ask me to put my trust in a... a phantom currency? And in return, you offer what—dreams of riches? Hmph. Bitcoin. No guarantees, no accountability. Tell me, Sollozzo, where is the respect in that?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(nervously)</span> Don Corleone, with your influence, you could dominate the crypto world. You'd be untouchable, feared.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(pauses, then stands, his tone final)</span> I’ll make you an offer, Sollozzo. You take this Bitcoin scheme to someone else. Leave my family out of it. My loyalty lies with things I can trust... and respect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(realizing his pitch has failed, bows slightly)</span> As you wish, Don Corleone.</p>
        </div>

           For some reasons that I haven't researched and for some rumors that remain uninvestigated, the biden administration seemed to dislike bitcoin and overall crypto currencies.
          However, this unfavorable stance toward Bitcoin might be on the verge of significant change.
        </p>
        <p>
           Just like the CHIPS Act and the Build Back Better plan that Biden proposed and implemented, people can see this shift coming—it’s no secret. The proposals have always been transparent. Trump is pro bitcoin. But how many actually prepared for it? Did you buy CAT at $140 or STLD at $30? I’m guessing you didn’t. Alas, neither did I.
        </p>
        <p>
           Unfortunately, pitching crypto is far harder than pitching cocaine or industrial stocks. Unlike those assets, crypto has no intrinsic value. And just like maniacs tout, "You know nothing about your buyer." 
        </p>
        <p>
           This will make value investors nervous. If you don't know your buyer, how can you make sure to sell it at a higher price? Yet, there are other factors to consider. One key factor I’ll highlight is this: "Never underestimate the power of the United States—or its president."
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
           BTW, do you know that Buffett once bought 110 million ounces of silver?
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        How likely will Trump promote crypto? Will his team fully support him?
        </p>
        <p>
           It's the nature of his kind to promote crypto, and it is the nature of his team members, such as Elon Musk and David Sacks, to take the pro-crypto policies steps further.
        The beauty of this dynamic is, you don't know much of the crypto hype yet, but it will very likely go beyond your expectation.
        </p>
        <p>
           Trump actually did an excellent job picking his senior officials. This should make the crypto investing much safer, well, at least for the next 3 years.
        </p>
        <p>
           Just like what I told my dad, "buy every dip in Tesla."
        </p>
        <p>
           Now is your time to shine, "buy every dip in Crypto."
